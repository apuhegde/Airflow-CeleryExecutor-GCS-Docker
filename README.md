# Upload data to GCS using Airflow (CeleryExecutor) run via Docker

This project shows you how to run Airflow in a Docker container to upload data to Google Cloud Storage (GCS). The goal is to analyze NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission data after uploading it to GCS. For now I've only worked on the Airflow pipeline portion, the analysis will follow eventually.

A lot of the original code has been used from the Data Engineering Zoomcamp course on GitHub [https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) and Alvaro Navas Peire's notes [https://github.com/ziritrion/dataeng-zoomcamp](https://github.com/ziritrion/dataeng-zoomcamp).
